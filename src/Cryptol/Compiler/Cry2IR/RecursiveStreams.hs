The `i`-th element of a sequence may be defined used the following equations:

@
    (a # b) \@ i
      | i < |a|     = a \@ i
      | otherwise   = b \@ (i - |a|)

    drop`{n} a \@ i  = a \@ (i + n)

    [a,b,c] \@ i
      | i == 0 = a
      | i == 1 = b
      | i == 2 = c

    [ e | a <- xs | b <- ys ] \@ i =
      let a = xs \@ i
          b = ys \@ i
      in e

    [ e | a <- xs, b <- ys, c <- zs ] \@ i =
      let (xy_i,z_i) = divMod i    |zs|
          (x_i, y_i) = divMod xy_i |ys|
          a = xs \@ x_i
          b = ys \@ y_i
          c = zs \@ z_i
      in e

    reverse xs \@ i = xs \@ (|xs| - 1 - i)
