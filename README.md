This repository contains the source code for a compiler from
Cryptol to Rust---a collection of Cryptol modules is translated into
a Rust crate.

The compiler is not yet stable, and is under active development!

For documentation on how to use the compiler, please have a look
at the [User's Guide](https://galoisinc.github.io/cryptol-compiler/index.html)
